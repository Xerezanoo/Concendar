# Concendar
Concendar is an app where you can manage all your concerts. It is very simple to use.
Nowadays, it is only available to use in your Shell, but I will be developing it to improve it ;)

HOW TO USE IT:
You have to get into the directory where you have it downloaded and type in your Shell --> 
python3 concendar.py
